        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 23 year old student. I live in an apartment in Varberg, just south of Gothenburg.
          Usually in my spare time I play games with my friends or practice drums with my band. This have I done since I was 7 years old, and I still enjoy it just as much.

          If I have some time to spare I like to spend it with the family dog, Båtsman. We usually go for long hikes in the forest.<br>
          I like to learn new things and I love connecting with new people. Because of that I enjoy working in a team, but I always stay focused on my own tasks and do my work to best of my abilities.<br>
          <br>
          After graduating from High School I started working as a care assistant for Varbergs Omsorg. I really enjoyed it but after doing it for three years I felt that my creative and problem solving self wasn't satisfied.
          Since I like technology I started working as a Fiber Techinician for Optotech AB, but quickly realised that I actually wanted to study software development. This has been the best choice I have ever made.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have always had a huge interest for IT, specifically programming, since I like to know how things are made from the ground up.
          I like to think that I have a very driven personality, when I find something I enjoy, I do it to the fullest.<br>
          <br>
          As of now I am on the lookout for an internship employment as a software developer in Gothenburg. Looking forward to hear from you!
